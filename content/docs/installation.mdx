import { CodeBlock } from "@/components/ui/code-block";

## Prerequisites

haber-ui requires the following to be installed in your project:

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

## Steps

1. Set up shadcn/ui (if not already done)

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

2. Install haber-ui components

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://haberui.com/h/feature-toggle.json"
```

Replace with the specific component you want to install.

That's it!

Visit the [components page](/docs/components) to see the list of available components.
