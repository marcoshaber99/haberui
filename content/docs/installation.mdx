## Prerequisites

haber-ui requires the following to be installed in your project:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) v4
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) latest version

## Steps

1. Set up shadcn/ui (if not already done)

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

2. Install haber-ui components

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://haberui.com/h/thinking-state.json"
```

Replace with the specific component you want to install.

3. Use the component in your application

```tsx
import { ThinkingState } from "@/components/haber-ui/thinking-state";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <ThinkingState
      variant="pulse"
      messages={["Processing data...", "Almost done..."]}
    />
  );
}
```
